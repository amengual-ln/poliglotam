  <h3 class="mt-2">Purpose</h3>
  <p class="py-2">
    The provider, responsible for the website, makes this document available to
    users to comply with the obligations set out in Law 34/2002 on Information
    Society Services and Electronic Commerce (LSSI-CE), as well as to inform all
    users of the website about the conditions of use of the website.
  </p>
  <p class="py-2">
    Anyone who accesses this website assumes the role of user, committing to the
    rigorous observance and compliance with the provisions set out here, as well
    as any other legal provision that may be applicable.
  </p>
  <p class="py-2">
    The provider reserves the right to modify any type of information that may
    appear on the website, without any obligation to give prior notice or inform
    the users of such obligations, with publication on the provider's website
    being understood as sufficient.
  </p>

  <h3 class="mt-2">Responsibility</h3>
  <p class="py-2">
    The provider exempts itself from any type of responsibility derived from the
    information published on its website, provided that this information has
    been manipulated or introduced by a third party unrelated to it.
  </p>
  <p class="py-2">
    The provider's website may use cookies (small information files that the
    server sends to the computer of the person accessing the page) to carry out
    certain functions that are considered essential for the correct operation
    and visualization of the site. The cookies used on the website are, in any
    case, of a temporary nature with the sole purpose of making their subsequent
    transmission more efficient and disappear at the end of the user's session.
    Under no circumstances will cookies be used to collect personal information.
  </p>
  <p class="py-2">
    From the client's website, it is possible to redirect to content from
    third-party websites. Given that the provider cannot always control the
    contents introduced by third parties on their websites, it does not assume
    any type of responsibility with respect to such content. In any case, the
    provider declares that it will proceed to the immediate removal of any
    content that could contravene national or international legislation,
    morality, or public order, proceeding to the immediate withdrawal of the
    redirection to said website, informing the competent authorities of the
    content in question.
  </p>
  <p class="py-2">
    The provider is not responsible for the information and content stored,
    including but not limited to, in forums, chats, blog generators, comments,
    social networks, or any other medium that allows third parties to publish
    content independently on the provider's website. However, and in compliance
    with the provisions of art. 11 and 16 of the LSSI-CE, the provider makes
    itself available to all users, authorities, and security forces, actively
    collaborating in the removal or, where appropriate, blocking of all content
    that could affect or contravene national or international legislation, the
    rights of third parties, or morality and public order. In the event that the
    user considers that there is any content on the website that could be
    susceptible to this classification, please notify the website administrator
    immediately.
  </p>
  <p class="py-2">
    This website has been reviewed and tested to ensure it functions correctly.
    In principle, correct operation can be guaranteed 365 days a year, 24 hours
    a day. However, the provider does not rule out the possibility of certain
    programming errors, or that causes of force majeure, natural disasters,
    strikes, or similar circumstances may occur that make access to the website
    impossible.

    responsibility for determining the specific content accessed by minors lies

    Internet, they will have to establish mechanisms on their computers, in
    particular computer programs, filters, and blocks, that allow limiting the
    available content and, although they are not infallible, they are especially
    useful for controlling and restricting the materials that minors can access.
